     <p>Sri Chaitanya started its historic journey in 1986 with the inception of a Girls Junior College at Vijayawada. And since then there has been no turning back. The inception of Sri Chaitanya Educational Institutions was the result of a vision rather than the mere setting up of an institution.Dr B.S. Rao, Founder and Chairman of Sri Chaitanya Educational Institutions, is an icon in the field of higher education. If practising medicine was his profession, being an educationist is his passion.Over the years Sri Chaitanya branched out across the length and breadth of not only the home states but across India (cf. map). There are 293 branches of Junior Colleges and 380 branches of Schools. It is now a trusted house hold name across the country.What is Techno Curriculum? The Main Objective of the TECHNO SYLLABUS is to give the students a Good Foundation in the Prestigious IIT's, NIIT'S, AIIMS, JIPMER, AIPMD, DEEMED UNIVERSTIES and other Medical and Engineering Institutes and other streams with ease and comfort.Sri Chaitanya techno school is a very good place to groom your child . The kind of quality education they provide and the experience level teachers possess they have all qualities to become one of the top educational institutions in india.</p>

         <p class="text-muted text-left">A library is a collection of materials, books or media that are easily accessible for use and not just for display purposes. It is responsible for housing updated information in order to meet the user's needs on a daily basis. A library provides physical (hard copies documents) or digital access (soft copies) materials, and may be a physical location or a virtual space, or both. A library's collection can include printed materials and other physical resources in many formats such as DVDs, CDs and Cassette as well as access to information, music or other content held on bibliographic databases.</p>

         <p class="text-muted text-left">The organisation and contents of laboratories are determined by the differing requirements of the specialists working within. A physics laboratory might contain a particle accelerator or vacuum chamber, while a metallurgy laboratory could have apparatus for casting or refining metals or for testing their strength. A chemist or biologist might use a wet laboratory, while a psychologist's laboratory might be a room with one-way mirrors and hidden cameras in which to observe behavior. In some laboratories, such as those commonly used by computer scientists, computers (sometimes supercomputers) are used for either simulations or the analysis of data. Scientists in other fields will use still other types of laboratories. Engineers use laboratories as well to design, build, and test technological devices.</p>

         <p class="text-muted text-left">A computer lab is a space which provides computer services to a defined community. Computer labs are typically provided by libraries to the public, by academic institutions to students who attend the institution, or by other institutions to the public or to people affiliated with that institution. Users typically must follow a certain user policy to retain access to the computers. This generally consists of the user not engaging in illegal activities or attempting to circumvent any security or content-control software while using the computers.In public settings, computer lab users are often subject to time limits, in order to allow more people a chance to use the lab, whereas in other institutions, computer access typically requires valid personal login credentials, which may also allow the institution to track the user's activities. Computers in computer labs are typically equipped with internet access, while scanners and printers may augment the lab setup. Computers in computer labs are typically arranged either in rows, so that every workstation has a similar view of one end of the room to facilitate lecturing or presentations,or in clusters, to facilitate small group work.In some cases, generally in academic institutions, student laptops or laptop carts take the place of dedicated computer labs, although computer labs still have a place in applications requiring special software or hardware not practically implementable in personal computers.</p>

Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike.
